Here's a detailed example of what you can include in your **README.md** for the movie genre classification project:

---

## 🎬 Movie Genre Classification

This project builds a machine learning model to classify movie genres based on plot summaries using **TF-IDF** vectorization and popular classification algorithms like **Naive Bayes**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**.

---

### 🔧 Project Features:
- **Data Loading & Preprocessing:** Efficient data cleaning and preparation of the dataset.
- **Feature Extraction:** Utilizes **TF-IDF** to convert textual descriptions into numerical features.
- **Model Training:** Implements and compares three classification algorithms:
  - **Naive Bayes:** Effective for text data.
  - **Logistic Regression:** Reliable for binary and multi-class classification.
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Powerful for high-dimensional data.
- **Model Evaluation:** Analyzes model performance using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix

### 📂 Project Structure:
```
├── netflix_titles.csv          # Dataset containing movie descriptions and genres
├── Movie_Genre_Predictor.py    # Main code file for model training and evaluation
└── README.md                   # Project documentation
```

---

### 🚀 Getting Started:

#### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn

#### Installation:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

#### Running the Model:
```bash
python Movie_Genre_Predictor.py
```

---

### 📊 Sample Results:
- The models are evaluated using the test set, and the evaluation metrics are displayed for comparison.
- The best model can be selected based on overall accuracy and other evaluation metrics.

---

### 💡 Future Scope:
- Explore advanced techniques like **word embeddings** (Word2Vec, GloVe) for better feature extraction.
- Implement deep learning models like **LSTMs** or **transformers** for improved performance.
- Expand genre classification to handle multiple genres per movie.

---

### 📁 Dataset:
The dataset used is the **Netflix Titles Dataset**, containing:
- **Description:** Plot summary of movies.
- **Listed_in:** Genre of the movie.
